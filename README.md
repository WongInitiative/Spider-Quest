# Welcome to Spider Quest!

Spider quest is an arcade-style game coded in Unity where you play as a spider that defeats enemies by creating web loops around them. When you create a complete loop of webs, all the enemies within the loop will be defeated, increasing your score. However, deploying webs will lower your speed, so use them wisely.

Every enemy has a unique movement pattern that will force the player to make quick decisions on the fly. Be aware that the pace of the game accelerates the longer you survive. Good luck webbing!
