# Welcome to Spider Quest!

Spider quest is an arcade-style game coded in Unity where you play as a spider that defeats enemies by spinnning webs around them. Every enemy has a unique movement pattern that will force the player to make quick decisions in order to survive. The pace of the game accelerates over time so stay alert. Good luck webbing!
